It is a collaboration between my significant other, Nick Mangubat, and me, created in honor of his late mother, Donna Mangubat. As his biggest supporter, she encouraged his dreams and once told him that his croissants were better than any bakery’s. That simple, heartfelt praise became the spark for something bigger. Together, we are turning her words into a warm, welcoming brand where her memory lives on through his craft and my design."
